# Analysis and Forecast of Electricity Generation in Colombia's National Interconnected System (SIN)

## Description

This project focuses on the analysis and forecast of electricity generation in Colombia's National Interconnected System (SIN). Through web scraping, data manipulation, and various analytical methods, the aim is to understand trends and relationships in electricity generation. This project utilizes pandas, scikit-learn for linear regression models, and numpy for numerical operations. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard has been created to effectively visualize the findings.
